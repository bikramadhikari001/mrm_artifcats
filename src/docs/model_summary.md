2. Debt-to-Income Ratio
3. Annual Income
4. Credit Utilization
5. Employment Length
6. Loan Amount
7. Number of Credit Lines
8. Recent Inquiries
9. Loan Purpose
10. Home Ownership

## Performance Metrics
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.85
- **Precision**: 0.72
- **Recall**: 0.68
- **F1 Score**: 0.70
- **Gini Coefficient**: 0.70

## Model Validation Results
- **Out-of-Time Performance**: ROC-AUC = 0.83
- **Population Stability Index**: 0.12

## Key Assumptions
1. Historical default patterns remain relevant
2. Feature relationships remain stable
3. Economic conditions similar to training period
4. Data quality remains consistent
5. No major policy changes in lending criteria

## Known Limitations
1. Limited to approved loan applications
2. May not capture new fraud patterns
3. Sensitive to macroeconomic changes
4. Geographic coverage gaps
5. Limited history for new credit users

## Monitoring Plan
- **Daily**: Performance tracking dashboard
- **Weekly**: Population stability monitoring
- **Monthly**: Full model performance review
- **Quarterly**: Bias and fairness assessment

## Risk Mitigation
1. Conservative threshold setting
2. Manual review for high-risk cases
3. Regular model retraining
4. Automated monitoring alerts
5. Backup scoring system

## Implementation Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn 1.0+
- Daily data pipeline
- Real-time scoring API
- Monitoring dashboard

## Regulatory Considerations
- Fair lending compliance
- Model risk management guidelines
- FCRA requirements
- ECOA compliance
- Adverse action notice requirements

## Next Steps
1. Complete documentation package
2. Independent validation
3. Production implementation plan
4. Monitoring setup
5. Training for business users
