### 2. Feature Stability
- Credit score remains a reliable indicator of creditworthiness
- Income verification processes remain consistent
- Debt-to-income ratio calculation methodology unchanged
- Employment length continues to be relevant for risk assessment

### 3. Economic Conditions
- No major economic disruptions during model application
- Interest rate environment remains relatively stable
- Unemployment rates within historical ranges
- Housing market stability
- Inflation within normal bounds

### 4. Business Process
