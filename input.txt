Model Development Notebook (or similar): Instead of a formal "Model Documentation," the initial deliverable is likely a Jupyter Notebook (or similar), containing the code, data exploration, model training, and initial results. This provides a much more transparent view of the development process.

Data Sample & Source Information: A representative sample of the data used, along with clear metadata describing the source, any pre-processing steps, and potential biases. The entire dataset is rarely shared directly due to size and security concerns.

Model Summary Report (Informal): A concise summary of the model's purpose, key features, and preliminary performance metrics. This is less of a formal report and more of a high-level overview to inform the MRM team quickly.

Model Version & Code Repository Access: Access to the version-controlled code repository (e.g., Git) rather than a static code file. This allows MRM to track changes, inspect intermediate versions, and understand the evolution of the model.

Performance Metrics (Early Iteration): Preliminary performance metrics, often visualized rather than just presented numerically, highlighting areas of strength and weakness.

Initial list of Assumptions and Limitations: An informal but clear list of the model's core assumptions and known limitations, as these are identified during the development process. This list will be refined as MRM progresses.

Key Preprocessing Steps Description: Concise description of important data cleaning and transformation steps, especially those that could introduce bias or have a significant impact on results.
